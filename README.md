## Financial Terminologies
  - `Balance`: refers to the cash you are holding, e.g., $100 cash in hand.
  - `Portfolio`: refers to the collection of the stocks you are holding, e.g. if you buy 100 shares of APPL(Apple Inc.), and sell 50 shares of AMZN(Amazon), your portfolio will include these two stocks.
    - Portfolio Value: refers to the market value of the stocks you are holding, e.g., if the current market price of APPL is $10 per share and the current market price of AMZN is $5 per share, your portfolio value is 100*$10 + (-50)*$5 = $750
  - `Assets`: your wealth, `assets` = `cash balance` + `portfolio`
  - `Position`: refers to the __quantity__ of shares you hold. It can be __positive__(long position), __zero__, or __negative__(short). ❗notice that quantity can be negative
    - positive quantity is easy to understand, e.g., if you buy 100 shares of APPL, your position will be +100.
    - negative quantity means you borrow some shares from others, e.g. if sell 100 shares of APPL that you don't own, your position will be -100. However, you are expected to buy the 100 shares back one day.
  - Order Entry： You send `buy` or `sell` orders to the market
    - `Buy`(`+`): when you buy shares of stocks, you pay cash, and the stock's quantity increases.
    - `Sell`(`-`): when you sell shares of stocks, you get cash, and the stock's quantity decreases.
