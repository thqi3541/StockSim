# Accessibility Report for StockSim

## 1. Equitable Use

### **Implemented Features:**

- StockSim aims to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by maintaining a straightforward interface that minimizes the need for fine motor skills. While the current version lacks certain accessibility-specific features, the foundational design is simple enough that users from various backgrounds can navigate it without requiring specialized assistance.


- StockSim provides a simulated trading experience for users regardless of their financial status, allowing equal access to stock trading education without requiring real monetary investments.


- The design is consistent across all user accounts, ensuring no specific user group is given an advantage. All users have access to the same set of features and tools.


- All features of StockSim, such as viewing portfolios, trading, and reviewing transaction history, are available to all users without limitation, ensuring there is no segregation based on user account type.


### **Future Features:**

- To ensure the app can be used by individuals with disabilities, we could integrate screen reader compatibility, which will assist visually impaired users in understanding all elements on the screen.

- Adding descriptive tags to all non-text elements, such as images or icons, so that these elements can be conveyed through audio. Using Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) properties, we could make complex components like the stock table more comprehensible by allowing screen readers to announce each table header and associated data as users navigate it, making stock performance information easy to interpret without needing to see the screen.


- We could implement a feature that adjusts the complexity of the interface based on a user's experience level, providing a simpler version for beginners and a more detailed view for advanced users. To achieve this, we would create a user profile system that tracks user experience, either through explicit input (e.g., users self-identify their experience level during onboarding) or implicit behavior tracking (e.g., the system records user actions to assess familiarity).


- Integrating multi-language support would make the design appealing and usable for a more diverse audience, avoiding any exclusion due to language barriers. This could be implemented by creating a translation module that supports multiple languages. Users could select their preferred language during onboarding or change it later in the settings.

## Target Audience

If StockSim were to be marketed or licensed to customers, the primary audience would be beginner to intermediate retail investors interested in learning more about the stock market in a safe, simulated environment. The program is targeted towards people who may be curious about stock trading but are hesitant to invest real money without gaining some experience first. This includes students studying finance or economics, young professionals exploring investment options, and hobbyists interested in the mechanics of trading. The app's goal is to demystify stock trading by providing users with a realistic yet risk-free environment to learn, practice, and refine their trading strategies.

The program could also be beneficial for educational institutions, such as high schools or universities, that offer courses in finance or economics. By licensing StockSim to these institutions, educators could use the platform as a teaching tool to help students better understand financial concepts, market behaviors, and investment strategies in a hands-on manner.



## Accessibility Considerations for Different Demographics

While StockSim aims to be as accessible as possible, certain demographics may be less likely to use the program effectively without further development. For example, individuals with visual impairments may find it challenging to interact with the interface as it stands. We currently lack features like screen reader compatibility, alternative text for images, or high-contrast modes, which are crucial for visually impaired users. Moreover, older adults who may be interested in learning about the stock market might struggle with navigating a digital interface, especially if they lack familiarity with modern technology.

In terms of digital equity, those who do not have easy access to technology, such as a stable internet connection or a capable computing device, may find it challenging to use StockSim. Additionally, the current interface primarily uses English, which may exclude non-English speakers. Including multi-language support could make StockSim more accessible to a global audience. To fully address these gaps, we need to invest in assistive technology features, simplified interfaces, and localized content.
